     <b>NoAgendaApp:</b>
     </p>
     <p>
     I began working on this app in late 2012 with the hope of releasing it to the Play store.  Development was delayed earlier this year because I switch careers and started Grad school. Due to those two things, I have no hope of finishing this app in the near future. I have decided to release the app and the source code to the community using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">BSD License</a>. My hope is that someone else in the community will finish the app or learn
     from/reuse code. The app works but has some rough UI edges, I have been using it exclusively for the last 9 months to listen to the show.
     </p>

     <p>
     I am willing to add additional documentation, make small coding tweaks and accept code contributions if others are willing to take on finishing the project.
